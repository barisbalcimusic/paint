## About the Project

This project was created during our 12-month full-stack training program to explore a topic not covered in the curriculum. It was designed as a self-study project to see what we could achieve independently. Due to the focus on DOM manipulation and collaborative work flows, the project was kept simple.

## Contact

The project was developed in collaboration with Hannah Rein. You can find Hannah on GitHub at [@hannahnier](https://github.com/hannahnier).
